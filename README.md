### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

-   [Dj](https://reactjs.org/)
-   [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/TtUjDt19eIHxNQ4n5jps) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

## How To Use

<!-- Example: -->

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/tices0/React-Projects/github-jobs

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the app
$ npm start
```

After the page has loaded, you will see a list of jobs near the _city closest you_. Only 5 cities are shown at once, to see more use the **navigation** at the bottom.

Each job shows:

-   the company logo
-   the company name
-   the job title
-   the job's location
-   the job's posted time

There is also a `Full Time` tag added to jobs that offer full time positions.

To see a _job's description_, click on the job and you will be shown a sidebar with **how to apply** and the job's **related links**, and on the right there will be the job's **description**. Click on the `Back to search` button on the top left to go back to the previous page.

You can search for jobs using:

-   **keywords** in the search bar at the top
-   the **location** search bar to specify a location
-   one of the options under the location search bar

Use the `From Home` checkbox to only see _jobs that can be done remotely_.
